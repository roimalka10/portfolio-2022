#### A personal portfolio website made with React, Framer motion, Axios and more.

## Insights

After working in a real company as a front-end developer I wanted to redesign my
portfolio using my new and polished skills and make it better both code wise and ui/ux wise.

## Potential Future Features

- Redesigning my firetracker site.
- Redesiging my weather app. - DONE

Used Create-React-App for this project so to run locally

```
git clone
npm/yarn install
npm/yarn start
```
