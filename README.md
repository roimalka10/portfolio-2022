# 2022 Portfolio

#### A personal portfolio website made with React, Framer motion, Axios and more.

## Insights

After working in a real company as a front-end developer I wanted to redesign my
portfolio using my new and polished skills and make it better both code wise and ui/ux wise.

## Potential Future Features

- Redesiging my weather app. - DONE
- Redesigning my personal trainer site. - NEXT
- Redesigning my tesla clone.

Used Create-React-App for this project so to run locally

```
git clone
npm/yarn install
npm/yarn start
```

- Used pure css, React, Axios, Framer motion and more.
